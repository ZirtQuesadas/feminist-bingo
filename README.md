The Interactive Feminist Bingo Card is an interactive bingo card for the use of commenters at online feminist venues. It provides feminists with an easy way to identify trolls, suggests possible responses based on the squares chosen, and also generates a random kitten video if the player chooses not to engage with the troll upon winning.

The appearance of bingo squares once they have been selected was inspired by Barbara Kruger's [Your Body is a Battleground](http://broadartfoundation.org/artist_43.html) (1976).
