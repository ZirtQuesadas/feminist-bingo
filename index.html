		<p>Yeah, that's a troll you've got. Congratulations.</p>
		<p>You have a few choices at this point. You can go on the offensive and explain to your troll why they are wrong, wrong, wrong &mdash; we've helpfully provided a few remarks you might use as a starting point, based on the squares you got BINGO with &mdash;</p>
		<ul>
			<li data-slug="feminine">
				<span class="comment">But I like my women feminine.</span>
				<span class="retort">That doesn't give you the right to impose a standard of beauty on anyone else.</span>
			</li>
			<li data-slug="equalist">
				<span class="comment">Feminists have got it all wrong; I'm an equalist.</span>
				<span class="retort">While there are certainly reasons not to identify with the mainstream feminist movement &mdash; see also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Womanism">womanism</a> &mdash; there's a difference between legitimate critiques and erasing misogyny.</span>
			</li>
			<li data-slug="naturally-better">
				<span class="comment">Women are just naturally better at that stuff.</span>
				<span class="retort">Women are individuals, with individual strengths and weaknesses.</span>
			</li>
			<li data-slug="explain-it-to-me">
				<span class="comment">So if you know all about feminism, explain it to me.</span>

			</li>
			<li data-slug="patriarchy-hurts-men">
				<span class="comment">Patriarchy hurts men too!</span>
				<span class="retort">Patriarchy does hurt men. But right now, that's not what I want to talk about. You have the rest of the world to talk about men.</span>
			</li>
			<li data-slug="ruin-sex-for-everyone-else">
				<span class="comment">You just don't like sex, so you want to spoil it for everyone else.</span>
				<span class="retort">Other people's sex lives are not my problem.</span>
			</li>
			<li data-slug="rape-is-rare">
				<span class="comment">Rape is rare. You're just paranoid.</span>
				<span class="retort"><a href="http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/frequency-of-sexual-assault">Every two minutes, someone in the United States is sexually assaulted.</a></span>
			</li>
			<li data-slug="gave-it-away">
				<span class="comment">She gave it away plenty of times before.</span>
				<span class="retort">Having had sex before doesn't take away your right to consent.</span>
			</li>
			<li data-slug="gave-you-the-vote">
        <span class="comment">We gave you the vote, now shut up.</span>
        <span class="retort">Suffrage isn't the only way to use my voice, and it wasn't the only goal of the women's rights movement.</span>
     </li>
     <li data-slug="treated-like-a-lady">
        <span class="comment">If you want to be treated like a lady, you'd better start acting like one.</span>
        <span class="retort">I'd rather be treated as a <em>person</em>.</span>
      </li><li data-slug="objective-about-gender-issues">
        <span class="comment">Women just can't be objective about gender issues.</span>
        <span class="retort">Then neither can men.</span>
      </li><li data-slug="laid">
        <span class="comment">You'll never get laid with that attitude.</span>
        <span class="retort">My attitude is the sexiest thing about me.</span>
      </li><li data-slug="take-a-joke">
        <span class="comment">Can't you take a joke?</span>

        <span class="retort">Feminism is bigger and more complicated then just me.</span>
      </li><li data-slug="old-fashioned-gentleman">
        <span class="comment">I'm just an old-fashioned gentleman.</span>
        <span class="retort">Causing other people pain has never been in fashion, nor is it gentle, especially when you know better.</span>
      </li><li data-slug="cute-when-angry">
        <span class="comment">You're so cute when you're angry.</span>
        <span class="retort">You're so condescending when you're afraid of my point.</span>
      </li><li data-slug="that-time-of-the-month">
        <span class="comment">Is it that time of the month?</span>
        <span class="retort">My feelings are real, even if it is "that time of the month." (It's called a menstrual period, by the way. For future reference.) And it's rude to ask someone about her medical details.</span>
      </li><li data-slug="victim-mentality">
        <span class="comment">You've just got a victim mentality.</span>
        <span class="retort">You've just got a lot of luck, and are afraid to admit how much it benefits you.</span>
      </li><li data-slug="good-deep-dicking">
        <span class="comment">All you feminists need is a good deep-dicking.</span>
        <span class="retort">All I need is for the world to stop oppressing me because of my gender.</span>
      </li><li data-slug="overemotional">
        <span class="comment">You're being silly and overemotional.</span>
        <span class="retort">You're being condescending as an excuse not to listen to me.</span>
      </li><li data-slug="jelly-of-lust">
        <span class="comment">Women have all the power over men &mdash; you can reduce us to an uncontrollable jelly of lust!</span>

      </li><li data-slug="feminists-hate-men">
        <span class="comment">You feminists all hate men!</span>
        <span class="retort">Feminists are not a <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Hive_vagina">Hive Vagina</a>.</span>
      </li><li data-slug="nice-guy">
        <span class="comment">But I'm a nice guy!</span>

      </li>
      <li data-slug="what-more-do-you-want">
        <span class="comment">He said he was sorry! What more do you want?</span>
        <span class="retort">An apology is a good start &mdash; if it's sincere &mdash; but it's not the end of fixing damage.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="drunk">
        <span class="comment">Why were you <em>drunk</em>? You should know better than to be drunk anywhere unless you're sure it's safe!</span>
        <span class="retort">Choosing to drink doesn't equal choosing to be assaulted.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="just-groping">
        <span class="comment">It was just stupid groping! It's not like he <em>actually</em>...</span>

        <span class="comment">Why didn't you fight him off? Well, why didn't you fight <em>harder</em>?</span>
        <span class="retort">It is not the victim's fault that someone chose to hurt him or her.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="ruin-his-life">
        <span class="comment">If you keep this up, you're going to ruin his life.</span>
        <span class="retort">I'm not doing anything. He decided to commit a crime. All I want is justice.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="tawana-brawley">
        <span class="comment">Can you say "Duke lacrosse team"?</span>
        <span class="retort">The plural of anecdote is not data. <a href="http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates">54% of rapes</a> are not reported.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="manga">

      <li data-slug="jealous">
        <span class="comment">You're only jealous because you don't look like that.</span>

        <span class="comment">If you don't like it, don't read it.</span>

      <li data-slug="realism-in-media">
        <span class="comment">No one wants realism in media.</span>

      </li>
      <li data-slug="happens-in-real-life">
        <span class="comment">But rape happens in real life too!</span>

      <li data-slug="punished-for-biology">
        <span class="comment">Men can't help themselves. Why are you punishing us for our biology?</span>

      </li>
      <li data-slug="oppression-olympics">
        <span class="comment">Why are you complaining about this when women in Muslim countries are oppressed?</span>
        <span class="retort">Don't play <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Oppression%20Olympics">Oppression Olympics</a>. There's no gold medal at the end.</span>

      <li data-slug="just-not-good-enough">
        <span class="comment">There aren't many women in the field because they're just not good enough.</span>
        <span class="retort">Fields which implement gender-blind hiring practices <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/97/0512/0512-orchestra.html">demonstrate</a> that truly merit-based hiring is gender-equal.</span>

        <span class="comment">Are you calling me a misogynist?!</span>

        <span class="comment">If you don't want to get pregnant, just don't have sex.</span>

        <span class="retort">The American Psychological Association has <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/abortion/index.aspx">found</a> no evidence that a single abortion harms a woman’s mental health. It also found that women who report distress post-abortion typically have other risk factors for mental health problems.</span>

        <span class="comment">I'm sorry if you were offended.</span>
